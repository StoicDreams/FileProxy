# File Proxy
## From [Stoic Dreams](https://www.stoicdreams.com/home)

This .NET Framework library was created to simplify creating a proxy service for a website to allow a client to load a file from the website that is actually hosted at a different domain.

As a developer of several websites, I like to store common files in a central repository. But, certain website features require files to be loaded locally in order to take advantage of cacheing. And that's why I created this project. So I can retain my common files in my central CDN server, but load them to the client as if they were loaded locally from the website being visited.

# Getting Startet - Nuget.org

Included in the [Stoic Dreams Web Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/StoicDreamsWebServer/) package.

Or get the standalone [Stoic Dreams File Proxy](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FileProxy/) package.

### Prerequisites

This library was created as a .NET Standard library using Visual Studio 2019. To my knowledge you should be able to use this in any modern .NET Framework, .NET Core, or .NET Standard project.

Please contact me if you get any errors installing or using this project's associated Nuget package in any .NET project.
